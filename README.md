# Fleet

Fleet is a live results iOS and Android app for Athletics.

## The problem

As both an athlete and a software engineer, I found myself frustrated by the lack of a mobile-friendly way to check competition results. Whether I was looking up past performances or trying to follow my own events in real-time, the only available source was the Portuguese Athletics Federation website—a site that was completely unusable on mobile devices.

### The Birth of Fleet

Determined to solve this problem, I built **Fleet**, an app designed to bring real-time athletics results directly to mobile users. The process started with a **Python web scraper**, which periodically collected competition results from the Federation’s website and stored them in a database. From there, I developed a **React Native app** for both iOS and Android, allowing users to access results quickly and easily.

### Unexpected Growth

What started as a personal project quickly gained traction throughout the entire country. Athletes, coaches, and fans embraced Fleet as the go-to solution for following competitions live on their phones.

One major milestone came when I needed to publish the app on the **Apple App Store**, which required a 100€ developer fee. I launched a crowdfunding campaign—expecting it to take two weeks to reach the goal. To my surprise, the community rallied behind Fleet, and the campaign was fully funded **within just 30 minutes**.

### The Impact

Fleet became more than just an app; it became an essential tool for the Portuguese athletics community. This project reinforced my passion for building user-focused software and showed me the power of solving real problems with technology.
